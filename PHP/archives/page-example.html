<h2>Mind Power Manifesto</h2>
<h2>Page Example</h2>
<p>
<b>I AM POWERFUL!</b><br />
<p>Whatever I set my mind on having, I will have.<br />
Whatever I decide to be, I will be.<br />
The evidance is all around me.<br />
The power of my Will has brought me precisely to where I am right now.<br />
<br />
I have made the choices. I have held the toughts.<br />
I have taken the action to create my current reality.<br />
And I have the power to change it into whatever I want to be.<br />
With the choices I make, I am constantly fulfilling the vision I have for my life.<br />
<br />
If that does not seem to be the case -<br />
then I am deceiving my self about what I really want.<br />
Because what I really want, trully want, I will get!<br />
What I trully wanted in the past, I already have.<br />
<br />If I want to build a billion-dollar business,<br />
I will take the actions necessary to do it.<br />
If I want to sit comfortably writing code night after night,<br />
I will take the action necessary for that.<br />
<br />
Don't be disappointed in my results -<br />
they're just outward manifestation of my priorities<br />
I will be sure of what I truly want,<br />
because I am sure to get it!<br />
<br />
