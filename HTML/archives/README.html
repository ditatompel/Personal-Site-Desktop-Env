<p><span class="quotes">&quot;But did you ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker?<br />
  Did you ever wonder what made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him? I am a hacker, enter my world...&quot;</span><br />
  (<span class="Penting">&quot;The Conscience of a Hacker&quot;, The Mentor</span>)</p>
<p>To study a system, to discover weaknesses, the peculiarities and hidden features of it, and then use them to go beyond its limits, with creativeness and imagination.</p>
<p>Define:Hacker<br />
  1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.<br />
  2. One who programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys programming rather than just theorizing about programming.<br />
  3. An expert at a particular program, or one who frequently does work using it or on it;<br />
  4. One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations.<br />
Besides, hackers are tolerant by nature, and rarely get angry, but they are irritated by people and tasks perceived to be wasting their time.</p>
<p>A hacker is never satisfied with the default settings of a program or of the custom installations, he always has to open the configuration menu and set the options to get the maximum performance, and to make the product work as close as possible to his &quot;way&quot;. A hacker must be able to use, to modify and to check all the possible features of a program.<br />
A hacker can often be in ecstasy reading some code written by another hacker, admiring his ability and &quot;tasting&quot; his style, as if he was reading poetry.</p>
<p>But, perhaps more than anything else, curiosity and above average intelligence are the signatures of a true hacker. The hacker has an almost physical need of knowledge of any kind.<br />
  The hacker is most certainly a voracious reader, even if his preference is only for scientific matters or science fiction, and generally one would find many shelves full of books in his room. But a hacker is not satisfied by the &quot;ready made&quot; knowledge, of the information that he finds in the books written for the average person, a hacker wants it all, and collects all possible information.<br />
</p>
<p>what motivates hackers? Why do they create programs that exploit advanced techniques and then distribute them free? And why do they freely distribute knowledge that was incredibly difficult to obtain?<br />
  What makes people write software and distribute it for free? Vanity, you said? Well, maybe.. But after all, what is this business all about? Is it all about money? Ask anyone - it's not. Most people I know in the community will tell you that.<br />
  Their idea is <span class="Penting">&quot;just leave me alone and let me do what I love to do&quot;</span>.<br />
  In short, it's not about money. It's about feeling free to do what you want, and, just possibly, to find someone that appreciates your work.</p>
<p>In a file titled &quot;<span class="Penting">The Hotmail Hack</span>&quot; written by <span class="Penting">Digital Assassin</span> of the &quot;<span class="Penting">United Underground</span>&quot; (or &quot;<span class="Penting">U2</span>&quot;, for short), in which a weakness of the HotMail system is illustrated, through which it is possible to enter into the mailbox of another person, the author, at a certain point interrupts the explanation with these words:<br />
  <span class="quotes">&quot;....but before I tell you how to use that line, I'm going to side track for a little theory behind this hack. Because <strong>there's NO point in a hack, if you don't know how it works</strong>. That is <strong>the whole idea of hacking, to find out how systems work</strong>.&quot;</span><br />
  These are clear examples of what the real intent of a hacker is when he breaks a system. It's very close to the idea of a child that opens a toy to see how it works. The difference is that the hacker tries not to destroy the toy (aside from the fact that the toy is not his own...).</p>
<p>Breaking into a system is not seen by the hacker as a criminal action, but like a challenge. The idea is not to damage the &quot;victim&quot;, but to find a way to penetrate its defenses. It's the intellectual challenge, the curiosity, the will to experiment and to explore, this is what moves the hacker, not the will to damage someone or something, and not even to obtain personal profit.</p>
<p>&quot;<span class="Penting">the hacker's manifesto</span>&quot;: &quot;<span class="Penting">The Conscience of to Hacker</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class="Penting">Mentor's Last Words</span>&quot; <br />
  written by <span class="Penting">The Mentor</span> on January 8th 1986, and published for the first time on the e-zine Phrack, Volume One, Issue 7, Phile 3.<br />
  This text collects in a few paragraphs, a large part of the hacker philosophy, with touching results for most true hackers.<br />
  <span class="quotes">&quot;We explore... and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. <br />
  Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for.&quot;<br />
  </span>In these words, you will see the frustration of living in a defective world, that deprives the individuals that wish to rise above the mediocre, of the very information and resources they desire, to know what is kept hidden, and it condemns them hypocritically as criminals.</p>
<p>Hacking can be used like as a form of protest, breaking into and modifying the websites of very well known societies and government or military corporate entities, can be a way to make public certain injustices (especially attacks to the liberty of information or expression) or violations of human rights. </p>
<p>Hackers believe that essential lessons can be learned about the systems--about the world--from taking things apart, seeing how they work, and using this knowledge to create new and even more interesting things. They resent any person, physical barrier, or law that tries to keep them from doing this. This is especially true when a hacker wants to fix something that (from his point of view) is broken or needs improvement. Imperfect systems infuriate hackers, whose primal instinct is to debug them.</p>
<p>:Hacker Ethic:<br />
  1. The belief that information-sharing is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and facilitating access to information and to computing resources wherever possible.<br />
  2. The belief that system-cracking for fun and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.</p>
<p>As long as there have been computers, there have been hackers.</p>
<p align="center">-------------------EOF-------------------</p>
<p>Hacker = A person that is interested in something more then the average expert. A person dedicated to knowledge. A person driven by curiosity :-) (not exactly correct but the meaning that's worth something)</p>
